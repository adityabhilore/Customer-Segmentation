# Customer-Segmentation
Analysis Model is a Jupyter Notebook project showcasing the full data science workflow—data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Built with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, it’s beginner-friendly, well-documented, and adaptable to various datasets.

# Analysis Model – Data Science & Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, starting from raw dataset analysis to building and evaluating machine learning models. The work is done in a Jupyter Notebook, with step-by-step explanations for each stage, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate learners.

The project begins with **data preprocessing**, where missing values are handled, categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are scaled. Next, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is performed using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover important patterns, trends, and correlations in the dataset.

One of the key machine learning techniques applied here is **K-Means Clustering**, which is used for grouping similar data points based on their features. The notebook explains how the algorithm works, how to choose the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, and how to interpret the results. In addition to K-Means, other models can also be implemented for comparison, depending on the dataset.

The main tools and libraries used in this project are:
- **Python 3** – Main programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding environment
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms, including K-Means Clustering
